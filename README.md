# Breast_Cancer_Detection_Using_ML_Classifier
# This project focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques for breast cancer detection using a binary classification dataset. The dataset contains numerical features extracted from breast cancer scans, with no missing values. Our approach involves preprocessing the data, extracting relevant features, and employing various machine learning algorithms for classification. Through rigorous testing and evaluation, we identify effective models for distinguishing between malignant and benign cases. Our results demonstrate the potential of machine learning in augmenting diagnostic capabilities for early cancer detection, contributing to advancements in healthcare technology.
